## Introduction

This project integrates into [![Home Assistant Logo](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=Home%20Assistant&color=41bdf5&logo=home-assistant&logoColor=white)](https://www.home-assistant.io/) automagically using **MQTT Discovery** to provide an entity to show whether your computer (**_Windows only_**) is Offline, Online or Active.  
You can add a **MQTT Camera** entity by updating your _configuration.yaml_ file, so the currently active window is displayed in your Lovelace UI.  
Commands can be published via MQTT to retrieve a current snapshot of the active window or to send a notification that will pop up using the Windows Notification system.

## Installation

The simplest method to get started is to copy computerassistant.exe from [releases](https://github.com/malcolmcdixon/computerassistant/releases) to any folder.  
**Suggestion**: add to the startup folder.

Alternatively, [clone or download](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/getting-changes-from-a-remote-repository#cloning-a-repository) the source code, preferably into a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and run  
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Configuration

Ensure you have the [MQTT Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt) added in Home Assistant.

Launch computerassistant.exe or if running from source code enter:  
`$ python ca.py`

The program will appear in the notification area <img src="./images/computer-assistant-icon.png" alt="Computer Assistant Logo" height="24">

Select the <img src="./github_images/settings_menu.png" alt="Settings Menu"> menu item from the context menu and enter your MQTT server details and credentials in the form.

<img src="./github_images/settings.png" alt="Settings Dialog">

The _broker address_ **must** be a valid ip address, the text input control's background will be green when valid else red if invalid.

The _broker port_ defaults to 1883, change this to the port your MQTT broker uses (valid values 1024 to 65535).

Enter the _username_ and _password_ to connect to your broker.

**NOTE:** _The project has only been tested using port 1883 and with a username and password._

When Computer Assistant connects to the MQTT broker it will publish a config message on topic _homeassistant/sensor/computer-assistant/{your-computer-name}/config_, this will create the device automagically in Home Assistant.

Add the device to Lovelace.

### Add a MQTT Camera

Follow the [MQTT Camera](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/camera.mqtt/) instructions to configure the _virtual_ camera in your _configuration.yaml_.  
**Example**

```yaml
camera:
  - platform: mqtt
    topic: computer-assistant/sensor/Workstation/screenshot
    name: Workstation Active Window
    unique_id: Workstation
```

**NOTE:** Replace _Workstation_ with your computer's name.  
This will create a camera entity that you can then add to Lovelace.

## How to Use

### Sensor

In Lovelace UI select the Computer Assistant Sensor.

<img src="./github_images/computer-assistant-sensor.png" alt="Computer Assistant Sensor">

This will show the sensor details.

<img src="./github_images/computer-assistant-sensor-detail.png" alt="Computer Assistant Sensor Details">

You can see the history of when the computer was offline, online and active.  
The last active time is displayed and the currently active window if applicable.

### Camera

Selecting the camera is just like any other camera feed, it will display a larger image in its own window.

### Commands

There are only 2 commands, screenshot and notify, to use these publish a message via MQTT.

#### Screenshot

The screenshot command will instruct Computer Assistant to send an updated image of the active window.  
topic:  
_computer-assistant/sensor/{your-computer-name}/cmd/screenshot_

#### Notify

The notify command will create a notification in the Windows Notification
topic:  
_computer-assistant/sensor/{your-computer-name}/cmd/notify_  
payload:

```json
{ "title": "Test", "message": "A test" }
```

## Roadmap

This project was initiated mainly as a programming exercise to test my recently gained knowledge of Python, to learn Qt and to send notifications to my computer from Home Assistant automations in Node-Red.

This is my first public repository on Github, the code is far from perfect but works!

I don't have any particular plans for developing other features other than automating the MQTT Camera configuration, but I'd like to have it work on Linux too. However, if there's a particular killer feature you'd like then complete a [feature request](https://github.com/malcolmcdixon/computerassistant/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

## Support

I will try to help anyone having issues installing, configuring and using Computer Assistant where possible.
To obtain support please complete a [bug report](https://github.com/malcolmcdixon/computerassistant/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).
